    <h1>CICD</h1>

    <h2>What is CICD?</h2>

    <p>As developers, automation can be an incredibly useful tool to implement into our workflows to make tasks easier and more efficient. Imagine that every time we make changes to an application, we just need to save it and those changes are automatically backed up, tested, and deployed without us needing to intervene.</p>

    <p>This is the goal of good automation, to be able to take these routine tasks that can be repetitive and time consuming and have them done for us, allowing us to focus our time on other more pressing matters during development. We call this process of automating the testing and deployment of software CI/CD.</p>

    <p>CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) as the name implies is split into two individual categories. The first aspect, Continuous Integration covers working collaboratively on a project using a source control service such as GIT and then deploying the advanced features of source control such as branching, merging and automated testing to ensure that any code that is integrated into the main project results in minimum issues. This allows us to catch issues and problems early and often and minimise disruption to the completed project.</p>

    <p>The second aspect, Continuous Deployment, covers the automatic deployment of a project once it has been tested and integrated with no problems. This means that features and fixes are deployed quickly and easily, not only resulting in less work for the developers but also a more positive experience for the users.</p>

    <p>CI/CD pipelines are currently used by many organisations in industry, and several different resources and tools are available to implement them within your workflow. For this demonstration (and as we have now had previous experience using it) we are going to use GitHub’s in-built CICD tools, GitHub actions. </p>

    <h2>What Are GitHub Actions?</h2>

    <p>GitHub actions are part of GitHub’s powerful CICD platform that allow you add automation within your project. Actions are purposely designed to be easy to integrate into a project. </p>

    <p>The strength of GitHub actions lies within its flexibility, GitHub provide a large marketplace of pre-built actions that have been made by other users that you can add to your project as is, or you can make alternations to match your needs. Or if you feel like you need something more bespoke you can create your own GitHub actions from scratch using the built in API. </p>

    <p>To do this you need to write something called a YAML file, which you then give to the API which will translate them into commands for you. </p>
